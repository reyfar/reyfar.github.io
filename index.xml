      <description>The aim here is to become a better writer through practice. Although it sounds somewhat outdated, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better alternative to get into the habit of writing. The format of a blog gives me the opportunity to create long-form writing with the added self-imposed pressure of having to publish.
Rachel Thomas of Fast.ai wrote an excellent article on the benefits of writing a blog, covering things you can gain from writing a blog, which I won&amp;rsquo;t rehash here.</description>

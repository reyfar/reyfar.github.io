		<h1><a href="http://reyfarhan.com/posts/hello-world/">hello, world</a> </h1>

		<div class="post-content"><p>At the end of last year I decided to start writing a blog. The plan was simple, consisting of nothing more than putting up a blog engine and starting pet projects that I could write about.</p>

<p>Those would be the essential ingredients needed to get into the habit of writing. The blog would impose some self-inflicted pressure to write, and the projects would provide the material to cover. I could get the practice I need to incrementally become a better writer.</p>

<p>Of course, in reality, everything takes much longer than expected. Going against all my wisdom on the topic of productivity, I began work on a bunch of projects simultaneously. To add to the workload, I decided to start a daily intensive German language course. It&rsquo;s been a load to deal with. Progress has been steady and rewarding, even if much slower than expected. I have a clear path to close off each project and write about them here, with the first to come soon. I may also write about my experience of setting up this blog using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which took an unexpected amount of time and effort, but other than that it offers a free alternative to the likes of <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve been toiling away, I came across <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045">an article on why one should blog</a>, written by Rachel Thomas, one of the people behind <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">Fast.ai</a>. I won&rsquo;t rehash it here but it covers a lot of the motivations I had behind starting mine. Perhaps it is unexpected in a quantitative field like data science, but writing has often been a significant factor in successfully delivering work. The challenge has always been to simplify just the right amount to get a complex message across accessibly while keeping it largely intact. Narrative matters, and crafting one to justify why you&rsquo;ve reached a particular decision based on statistical or probabilistic considerations can be hard. The <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/12/the-curse-of-knowledge">curse of knowledge</a> makes things even more difficult.</p>

<p>During the process of setting this blog up, I didn&rsquo;t want to overthink writing. I simply wanted to get started, but quickly found that I needed to consider an approach, tone, and so on. I took to the internet to read various pieces of advice and found an <a href="http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/02/how-to-write.html">internal memo by David Ogilvy</a> to his employees titled &ldquo;How to Write.&rdquo; In it he says &ldquo;The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy &amp; Mather. People who think well, write well,&rdquo; which reinforces my belief that writing well can positively impact one&rsquo;s career. His other advice is equally worth taking note of. He states, &ldquo;Write the way you talk. Naturally,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good writing is not a natural gift,&rdquo; both of which I&rsquo;ll take as basic principles to work to.</p>

<p>Over recent years, I have consumed a lot of open source content, a lot of which comes from the field of data science. Most of this, such as the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Fast.ai deep learning course</a>, has helped my learning immensely. I hope that adding my own voice to the many out there can contribute in return, if I can indeed provide something useful to say.</p>

<p>That is about it for now. Thanks for reading, and I hope that something with some content value will find itself here soon.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting a blog. It sounds outdated, but it gives me a reason to practice long-form writing, along with the added pressure of publishing to the real-world. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really identified an audience, nor a plan for content, but I expect it will cover a range of things that interest me.
Rachel Thomas of Fast.ai wrote an excellent article on the benefits of writing a blog, covering things you can gain from writing a blog, which I won&amp;rsquo;t rehash here.</description>

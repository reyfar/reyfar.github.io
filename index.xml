      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Data Science lead, currently based in Berlin. Projects I’ve been involved in cover the full range of data science areas, including machine learning (or &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; as it is fashionably known), product analytics, business intelligence, data engineering and so on. I’ve worked across numerous sectors and for companies ranging from high-growth startups to global corporates. You can find further details on LinkedIn.
I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in product optimisation strategies and decision-making using data, as well as novel applications of machine learning.</description>

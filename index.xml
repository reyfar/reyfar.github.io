      <description>My aim here is to become a better writer through practice. It sounds outdated in 2020, but a blog seems like the best option for getting me into a habit of regular writing. The format gives me the opportunity to create long-form writing, along with the added pressure of having to publish.
Rachel Thomas of Fast.ai wrote an excellent article on the benefits of writing a blog, covering things you can gain from writing a blog, which I won&amp;rsquo;t rehash here.</description>

		<h1><a href="http://reyfarhan.com/about/">About</a> </h1>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a Data Science lead, currently based in Berlin. Projects I’ve been involved in cover the full range of data science areas, including machine learning (or &ldquo;AI&rdquo; as it is fashionably known), product analytics, business intelligence, data engineering and so on. I’ve worked across numerous sectors and for companies ranging from high-growth startups to global corporates. You can find further details on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyfarhan/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in product optimisation strategies and decision-making using data, as well as novel applications of machine learning.</p>

<p>Other interests include sound and music, and tinkering with software that generates them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also involved in these projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://agivenb.com/">A given B</a>, aka A|B, which is a collaborative effort I&rsquo;m kicking off to encourage closer links between data science and designers to improve how we work together.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nonrg.com/">NoNRG</a>, which is an ambient mix series hosted on SoundCloud with sporadic releases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

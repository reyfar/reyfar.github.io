		<h1><a href="http://reyfarhan.com/posts/001-first-post/">Starting a Blog in 2020</a> </h1>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;m starting a blog. It sounds outdated, but it gives me a reason to practice long-form writing, with the added pressure of publishing to the world. I haven&rsquo;t really identified an audience, nor a plan for content, but I expect it to cover a range of things that interest me.</p>

<p>Rachel Thomas of <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">Fast.ai</a> wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045">excellent article on the benefits of writing a blog</a>, covering things you can gain from writing a blog, which I won&rsquo;t rehash here. I was taken aback by how long she spent on her first post (9 months!), and I&rsquo;ll try to avoid something similar by pushing myself to publish quickly and often.</p>

<p>Like Rachel, I doubted that I had anything of interest to write about for anyone. What changed my mind was consuming a lot of open source content, particularly from the data science world. Most of this, such as the Fast.ai deep learning course, has helped my learning immensely, and asks for nothing in return. Adding my own voice to the many out there feels like a positive way of contributing back, if I can indeed provide something useful to say.</p>

<p>Most of the content will probably focus on technical matters, since I&rsquo;m a data scientist and many of my writing ideas now relate to that. Whether that stays that way or will change will be interesting to see.</p>

<p>Like Rachel again, I wish I had started sooner, but better late than never. Thanks for reading, and I hope that something with some content value will find itself here soon.</p>
